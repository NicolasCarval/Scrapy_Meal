# Scrapy_Meal
Webscrapping project

link of our video of presentation : https://youtu.be/lUN19aL4wJc 

Purpose :
We want to design a solution in order to scrap ingredients from a recipe (like from marmiton website) for a given meal.
Then compare the shopping list price from supermarkets (like Carrefour or Auchan).

Finally propose the best Supermarket to buy all the products needed for the recipe.
